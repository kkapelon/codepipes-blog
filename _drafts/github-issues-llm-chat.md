title: Using GitHub issues as an interface to your LLM/Agent
category: llms

## Introduction

Lately I have noticed a very alarming trend that affects several open source projects. People use GitHub issues as a chat interface. 

A person wants to contribute to the open-source project with the following process

1. The contributor uses their favorite agent/llm/chat/bot to create the code for the PR
1. They open the PR, and as description they just copy-paste the output of the LLM
1. The human maintainer sees the PR and adds comments
1. The contributor just copies-pastes the comments back to the LLM
1. The response and fixes from the LLM are again pasted back to the PR
1. ...and so on.

The results is essentially a standard LLM chat, but in asynchronous mode. Essentially using GitHub issues
as a relay service for whatever LLM the contributor is using.

On one hand getting more PRs in your project sounds a like a good problem to have. It means that people are using your project and also that they want to contribute to it. In fact, these people might not be able to contribute at all if they didn't have an LLM at their disposal.

On the other hand, these kinds of PRs (at the time of writing) need a lot of baby sitting and hand-holding. Creating the PR might take less effort for the contributors but increases the effort on behalf of the human maintainers.
