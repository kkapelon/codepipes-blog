title: Using GitHub issues as an interface to your LLM/Agent

## Introduction

Lately I have noticed a very alarming trend that affects several open source projects. People use GitHub issues as a chat interface. 

A person wants to contribute to the open-source project with the following process

1. They use their favorite agent/llm/chat/bot to create the code for the PR
1. They open the PR and as description they just copy-paste the output of the LLM
1. The human maintainer sees the PR and adds comments
1. The contributor just copies-pastes the comments back to the LLM
1. The response and fixes from the LLM are again pasted back to the PR
1. ...and so on.
