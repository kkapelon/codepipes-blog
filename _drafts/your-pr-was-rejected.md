## Introduction

If you are reading this, it probably means that an open source maintainer has sent you this blog
and asked you to read it. Maybe it was me after you opened a Pull Request to projects I maintain.

At the time of writing (early 2026) a lot of open source projects are getting bombarded with LLM/agent/AI Pull requests that are either irrelevant, badly designed or even completely wrong.

Several projects [have suffered](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2025/07/14/death-by-a-thousand-slops/) from this and open source maintainers are currently trying different approaches such as [rejecting](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw?tab=contributing-ov-file#making-changes), [restricting](https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/devel/contribute.html#restrictions-on-generative-ai-usage) or even [prohibiting](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/main/AGENTS.md#issue-and-pr-guidelines) Pull Requests altogether. While [new ideas](https://github.com/mitchellh/vouch) are also on the way, I personally believe that it is better to solve the problem at its root. Instead of combating Pull Requests I would like to educate YOU instead and help you improve yourself.

So if you really want to become a proper Open source contributor read on.
