My name is Kostis Kapelonis. I am mainly a software developer but I also love technical writing.
Contact information can be found on [my profile page](http://codepipes.com/contact.html).


## About the content

This blog contains my own opinions on several CI/testing/automation/deployment subjects. I am a true believer of automating everything that can be automated.
Testing is big passion of mine as it goes hand-in-hand with effective automation (you can deploy with confidence only if you trust your software tests). 

All posts are written
on my own free time. 
My contracted work can be found at my [technical writing page](http://codepipes.com). I am a professional
technical writer since 2011. I lately wrote a [Manning book](http://manning.com/kapelonis) for the [Spock testing framework](http://docs.spockframework.org/).
